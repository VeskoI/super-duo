## super-duo

Project 3 from [Udacity Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

**Alexandria** is a book list and barcode scanner app, whereas **Football Scores** is an app that tracks current and future football matches. 

The code for both apps was received from Udacity, my task was only to fix couple of bugs. Also added the actual Barcode scanner functionality in Alexandria and the Widget in Football Scores.

The apps' code remains far, far from perfect, but good enough to satisfy the requirements of this project.
